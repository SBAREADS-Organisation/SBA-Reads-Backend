### Key Components

#### 1. Controllers
Controllers handle HTTP requests and responses. They validate input, delegate to services, and format responses.

Key controllers include:
- `AuthController` - Authentication and authorization
- `UserController` - User management
- `BookController` - Book management
- `OrderController` - Order processing
- `KYCController` - Know Your Customer verification
- `CategoryController` - Category management

#### 2. Services
Services contain business logic and coordinate between controllers and repositories. They handle complex operations and transactions.

Key services include:
- `BookService` - Book creation, deletion, and purchase logic
- `OrderService` - Order creation and tracking
- `UserService` - User management operations
- `PaymentService` - Payment processing
- `StripeConnectService` - Stripe integration
- `CloudinaryMediaUploadService` - Media upload handling

#### 3. Repositories
Repositories abstract database operations and provide a clean interface for data access.

Key repositories include:
- `BookRepository` - Book data operations
- `OrderRepository` - Order data operations
- `TransactionRepository` - Transaction data operations

#### 4. Models
Models represent database entities and define relationships between them.

Key models include:
- `User` - User accounts and profiles
- `Book` - Book information and metadata
- `Order` - Order details and status
- `Transaction` - Payment transactions
- `Category` - Book categories

### Authentication & Authorization

The system uses Laravel Sanctum for API token authentication. Role-based access control is implemented using Spatie Laravel Permission package with roles including:
- `reader` - Can read and purchase books
- `author` - Can create and manage books
- `admin` - Can manage users and content
- `superadmin` - Full system access

### Data Flow

1. **Client Request** - Client sends HTTP request to API endpoint
2. **Route Matching** - Laravel router matches request to controller method
3. **Controller Processing** - Controller validates input and calls appropriate service
4. **Service Logic** - Service executes business logic, possibly calling multiple repositories
5. **Data Access** - Repositories interact with models to retrieve/update data
6. **Response Formatting** - Controller formats response using API resources
7. **Client Response** - Formatted response sent back to client

### Payment Processing

The system integrates with Stripe for payment processing:
1. Orders are created with pending status
2. Payment intent is created through Stripe
3. Client completes payment on frontend
4. Webhook receives payment confirmation
5. Order and transaction statuses are updated
6. Authors receive payouts based on sales

### File Storage

Files are stored using Cloudinary:
- Book covers and content files
- User profile pictures
- KYC documents

### Notification System

Notifications are sent through multiple channels:
- Email notifications using Laravel Mail
- In-app notifications stored in database
- Push notifications (planned)

### Caching Strategy

The system implements caching for performance optimization:
- Book listings are cached for 5 minutes
- User reading progress is cached
- Other frequently accessed data is cached appropriately

### Monitoring & Health Checks

The system includes monitoring endpoints:
- `/monitor/health` - Overall system health
- `/monitor/queue` - Queue status
- `/monitor/stripe` - Stripe connectivity
- `/monitor/cloudinary` - Cloudinary connectivity

## Database Design

### Key Tables

#### Users Table
Stores user account information including:
- Authentication details
- Profile information
- Account type (reader/author/admin)
- Settings and preferences
- KYC status and information

#### Books Table
Stores book information including:
- Title, description, and metadata
- Pricing information
- Publication details
- File references
- Status and visibility

#### Orders Table
Stores order information including:
- User reference
- Total amount
- Status tracking
- Delivery address reference

#### Transactions Table
Stores payment transaction information including:
- Payment provider references
- Amount and currency
- Status tracking
- Purpose references

#### Categories Table
Stores book categories for organization and search.

### Relationships

- Users can be authors of many books
- Books can have many authors
- Users can purchase many books
- Users can bookmark many books
- Books belong to many categories
- Users can place many orders
- Orders contain many items
- Transactions are associated with orders

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication** - All API endpoints require valid authentication tokens
2. **Authorization** - Role-based access control prevents unauthorized actions
3. **Input Validation** - All inputs are validated and sanitized
4. **Rate Limiting** - API requests are rate-limited to prevent abuse
5. **Data Encryption** - Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
6. **Secure File Storage** - Files are stored securely with Cloudinary
7. **Payment Security** - PCI compliance through Stripe integration

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Caching** - Redis caching for frequently accessed data
2. **Database Indexing** - Proper indexing for performance
3. **Queue Processing** - Background job processing for heavy operations
4. **Horizontal Scaling** - Stateless application design
5. **CDN** - Content delivery network for static assets
6. **Database Sharding** - Potential for database sharding as data grows

## Deployment Architecture

The application can be deployed using:
- Docker containers for consistency
- Load balancers for high availability
- Database replication for redundancy
- Cloud storage for file assets
- Monitoring and logging systems

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Laravel 10+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MySQL
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Queue**: Redis/Database
- **File Storage**: Cloudinary
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe
- **Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum
- **Authorization**: Spatie Laravel Permission
- **Mail**: SMTP/Amazon SES
- **Monitoring**: Custom health check endpoints

## Error Handling

The system implements consistent error handling:
- Standardized error response format
- Detailed error logging
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- Proper HTTP status codes

## Testing Strategy

The application should include:
- Unit tests for services and repositories
- Feature tests for API endpoints
- Integration tests for payment flows
- Database seeding for testing environments

## Maintenance Considerations

1. **Database Migrations** - Version-controlled schema changes
2. **Backup Strategy** - Regular database and file backups
3. **Monitoring** - Application and infrastructure monitoring
4. **Logging** - Comprehensive application logging
5. **Security Updates** - Regular dependency updates
6. **Performance Monitoring** - Response time and error rate tracking
